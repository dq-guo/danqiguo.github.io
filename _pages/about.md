Thanks for visiting my website! I am a last-year PhD candidate in Political Science at Freie UniversisÃ¤t Berlin (on the job market). I also work as a Predoctoral researcher at a research project on [Digital governance in China](https://www.digitalgovernancechina.eu/) funded by European Research Council at the same university. 

I have a deep passion for *interdiscipinary* approaches to studying complex questions with profound societal and political implications in the digital era, within as well as beyond a specific context. My research interests centre on various aspects of the interplay between politics and digitalization, including the macro-level transformation of politial structure and institution for modern autocracy and democracy, and the micro-levle interaction between the psychological dimension (esp. affect and emotion) and digital-enabled political control (aka. digital control). My dissertation project examines the origins, mechanisms, and consequences of digital authoritariansim through the lens of human emotion.
